       crammed into its compact territory - big skies, majestic hills,
       spectacular wildlife, superb organic food and hospitable,
       down-to-earth people. It is for those who have adventure in their
       hearts. According to Mr. R.C.S.Bell who was the first collector of
       Koraput district, the town gets its name from 'Kora-Putti' or 'the
       hamlet of the nux-vomica.'"

Take a spiritual walk through the old part to enjoy the quintessential temple town that the city was once. Then return to the new town for more earthly delights. Cave temples, an animal safari park, etc, are some of places that can be seen on an excursion tour. Puri and Konark are the other two arms of the Golden Triangle, which can be easily visited from Bhubaneswar"
